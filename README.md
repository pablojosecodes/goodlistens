Wanted to get some time away from React and SPAs, so built this "Goodreads for podcasts" with Flask.

Quick overview of the tech stack
- Flask + typical accoutrements (sqlalchemy, flask_login, flask_wtf, flask_migrate)
- SQLite3 (for quick local development)
- PostgreSQL (for deployment)
- ElasticSearch (full-text search)
- Docker (to deploy)
- Tiny bit of Ajax to make it feel responsive
